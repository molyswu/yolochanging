# Verified a few tests

- I varified the yolo on pascal voc works on corresponding tensorflow
- Applied inputpipeline and achieve performance improvement on des machine with single GPU pascal, this is so called thread-level parallelism
- Tried gRPC tensorflow by default communication way on 2 des machines, with one GPU on each. Performance is worse than second
- Tried Horovod allreduce on 2 des machines, but because of Network speed, still very slow. better than third, worse than second
- Tried gRPC on Tesla v100 workstation(4 gpu). gRPC by default works fine, because the speed are similiar on ecah machine, but synchronous
- Tried NCCL horovod all reduce on Tesla v100 workstation. Verified 2 things   
   -NCCL is better than gRPC on same workstation
   -TODO: Scalability graph of both gRPC and NCCL

# Install dataset and environ
In this horovod test, base test is fixed with warm-up and good local and global fps  
- cd pascalvoc/  
- bash download.sh  to download dataset(500 MB, sorry I only downlodaed one year data, but it is this big)
- (For environment, I only used tensorflow-gpu and opencv. If your environment does not work, try this). 
- cd env, bash build_env.sh


# Aim
- stable 99%-100% GPU usage for 2 tests.

#  Run 2 tests
### 1. Single machine training 
bash run_single.sh --watch_gpu=0 [--watch-gpu should be the same as the visible gpu]
### 2. Distributed training  
bash ps.sh  
bash worker0.sh --watch-gpu=0  
bash worker1.sh  --watch-gpu=1  
[--watch-gpu should be the same as the visible gpu]

# Change yolo_tensorflow/yolo/config.py
- Change parameters in yolo_tensorflow/yolo/config.py  
- For test1, just ignore PS_HOSTS and WORKER_HOSTS. Only change it for test2
- MUL_QUEUE_BATCH means how many times is the queue size is of batch_size. 2 means 10*2=20
- PROFILER_SAVE_STEP, SUMMARY_SAVE_STEP can not be too small, because I found especially summary take long time
- How does the yolo/config.py look like and where to change? change here
